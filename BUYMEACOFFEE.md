# Buy Me a Coffee ☕

## What is reportcard.fun?

**reportcard.fun** is a website that helps people in India report problems in their city or town. Things like broken roads, garbage not being collected, streetlights that don't work, and other everyday issues.

## What does it do?

We make it simple for regular people to:
- Take photos of problems and mark where they are on a map
- Create certificates that look official to share on social media
- File RTI (Right to Information) requests with ready-made forms
- Send emails to government officials with complaint templates
- Keep track of whether their problems are being fixed

## Why is this important?

In India, many problems don't get fixed because:
- People don't know how to complain properly
- The process is too complicated and takes too long
- There's no way to check if anything is happening
- People feel like they can't make a difference

**We're changing this.** We make it easy for people to report problems and hold government officials responsible.

## How does it help?

- **Anyone can use it** - You just need a phone
- **More transparency** - RTI forms help people get information
- **Public pressure** - Sharing on social media makes people aware
- **Accountability** - Documented problems are harder to ignore

## What technology do we use?

- **Next.js** - Makes the website fast and modern
- **TypeScript** - Makes the code reliable
- **Tailwind CSS** - Makes it look good on all devices
- **Open source** - Anyone can help improve it

## Why should you support us?
